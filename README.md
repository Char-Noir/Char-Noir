### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Danyil and I love programming.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [App for learning new languages](https://github.com/Char-Noir/DictonaryApp) and a few other small projects to make life easier for others and ourselves([Converter of minecraft schematics to excel](https://github.com/Char-Noir/minecraft_schematic_to_excel) and [Controlled SlideShow](https://github.com/Char-Noir/python_controlled_slideshow) ).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning MAUI, XAML, system analysis and data analysis.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking for opportunities to collaborate on the projects above or any project that is interesting or challenging enough. If you're not sure, don't hesitate to contact me.
